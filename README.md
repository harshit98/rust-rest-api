# REST API in Rust

Rust is a systems programming language which runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

Actix is an actor framework prevalent in the Rust ecosystem. I am using it as an HTTP server to build our REST API.


## Setup

1. Install Rust (with Actix) and Diesel (supports ORM)

2. Configure diesel by following steps mentioned here: http://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started.html

3. Make sure `cargo` is installed with Rust.
